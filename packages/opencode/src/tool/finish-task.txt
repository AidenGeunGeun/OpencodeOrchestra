Signal task completion and return a structured summary to the parent session.

Use this tool when:
- You have completed the assigned task from the parent (PM or orchestrator)
- You want to explicitly return control to the parent session
- You have a summary to hand off with status and learnings

This tool is ONLY available to orchestrator-mode agents. Subagents complete automatically.

When called, this tool will:
1. Record the task completion summary
2. Signal the session to finish and return to parent
3. Pass structured data back to the parent for their context

The parent session will receive your summary and can continue their work with the context you provided.
